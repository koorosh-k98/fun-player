# Fun Player

## Requirement

One of my family members is really into listening to offline radio records or podcasts on Telegram mobile application. Sometimes listening to a podcast becomes really boring, especially if you are listening to it at 1x speed. Unfortunately, Telegram just supports 1x, 1.5x, and 2x speed. 

In addition, there are always some situations you miss some part of the podcast you are listening to and just need a handy button in order to rewind 5 seconds.

## Response

I found it interesting to develop a player application which supports mp3, wav, and m4a formats, including a customizable speed feature from 0.1x to 6x with 0.1 steps. Likewise, I considered 2 separate buttons for rewind or forward 5 seconds.

## Features

- Retrieving artwork from the file
- Retrieving metadata (artist name, song name, etc.) from the file
- Picking a background color based on the dominant color of the artwork
- Favorite list
- Sorting based on name, size, date, type
- The ability to switch between SD card and internal storage
- Notification with previous, next, and pause/play button
- Animations for long texts and other minor components
- Support mp3, wav, m4a files
- Customizable speed (0.1x to 6x)
- The state of the last played file persists even after relaunching the app
